# Auto ( Clicker | Typer )
## Omaewa shindeiru
I used this to farm in games like **Cookie Clicker** and **Roblox** many years ago _(good times)_ . 

## Usage
### Quickest way? 
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. run `pip install pyautogui` in a terminal
3. set the keys you want pressed in `typer.py`
4. run `clicker.py` or `typer.py` from the terminal

### You are not a tech guy?
You would need to contact me somehow, and ask me to publish a `.exe` file _(or whatever)_. If I'm in a good mood, I might actually do it _(or you could ask someone else to do it)_.
